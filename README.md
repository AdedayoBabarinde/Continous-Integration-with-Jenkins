# Continous-Integration-with-Jenkins


In this project we  implement Continous Integration for Tooling Website using Jenkins.
In this project we are going to start automating part of our routine tasks with a free and open source automation server
- Jenkins. It is one of the mostl popular CI/CD tools.

We are going to utilize Jenkins CI capabilities to  ensure that every change made to the source code
in GitHub https://github.com/drazen-dee28/tooling.git will be automatically be updated to the Tooling
Website.
